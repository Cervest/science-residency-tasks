# Sciency residency task

Hi there! As part of the application process we would kindly ask you to complete two tasks. One of them is a coding task where you have to complete the script we have provided (see `code-to-complete/autoencoder_task.py`). Second task is to select on of the papers provided in `paper-to-review/` and provide us with a one page review of the paper. More info below.

### Autoencoder task

For an autoencoder task you will find most of the information in the docstrings of the file, complete the code and when you run it should you get a message saying that you succeeded! Do study the test function, it would help you complete the task! 

### Paper review task

Pick one of the papers in the directory and send us back a review that is at most one page. We are aiming to see how you can evaluate strengths and weaknesses of the paper, provide summary, limitations, and implications of the work.
